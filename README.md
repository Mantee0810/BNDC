# BNDCNet: Bilateral Nonlocal Decoupled Convergence Network for Semantic Segmentation

### Module Introduction
BNDC is a **end-to-end** module that is able to adapt itself to different sized inputs. 
Given an input feature map, the output feature map has the same shape and size.

This can be checked with the following codeï¼š
  ```
  print(feature_map.shape)
  ```

### Direct Use Methods

1. Place file **BNDCModule.py** in the same folder as the model.py.

2. In the model file, **import** the module as follows:
  ```
  from BNDCModule.py import BNDC
  ```

3. In the **__init__** function of the model, define it as follows:
  ```
  self.bndc = BNDC(channel)
  ```
&ensp;&ensp;where channel is the number of **channels of the feature map**

4. In the **forward** function, do the forward propagation as follows:
  ```
  map = self.bndc(map)
  ```

### Full Usage

The **models folder** gives the complete structure:

&ensp;&ensp;```BiseNet.py``` is the structural implementation of BiseNet
  
&ensp;&ensp;```BNDCModule.py``` is the structural implementation of BNDC
  
&ensp;&ensp;Insert the modules in the same way as the **Direct Use Methods**.
